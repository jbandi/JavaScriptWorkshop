      Angular is not a module loader, Angular just worries about our dependency graph.
      Thus, we need to add a script tag for each file we're using.
      However, script order isn't really all that relevant. As long as we have Angular on top,
      and then the script which declares our module, the rest of the scripts can be in whatever
      order we want, and Angular will deal with that for us.

      These could actually be in any order!
